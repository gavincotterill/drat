## Gavin Cotterill's mini-repo using `drat` 

`drat` ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drat), [GitHub](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat), [docs](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat)) makes it easy to host your own
CRAN-like repositories for packages (or [data](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-026/index.html)).

Currently this repo only contains `rnetcarto` version 0.2.5, which is copy of v 0.2.4 that was archived on CRAN in November 2021. I then made minor changes to the RMD and configure file that shouldn't influence performance. `rnetcarto` can be a bear to install, moreso on Windows machines than Mac in my experience.
